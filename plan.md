---

## 🔄 Development Methodology

### **Incremental Development Rules**
- **One feature per sprint** (following AI rules)
- **Test-driven approach**: Each feature must be tested before moving forward
- **Version control checkpoints**: Save working state after each feature
- **No scope creep**: Stick to planned features, document change requests separately

### **Quality Gates**
1. **Code Quality**: TypeScript compilation with 0 errors
2. **Functionality**: Feature works as specified in PRD
3. **Integration**: New feature doesn't break existing functionality  
4. **Performance**: Real-time features respond within 3 seconds
5. **Security**: All data access follows RBAC rules

## 🗄️ Database Architecture Plan

### **Core Tables (To Be Restored)**
```sql
-- Account Management
accounts (id, accountId, customerName, phoneNumbers, email, status, etc.)
calls (id, accountId, agentId, duration, disposition, notes, etc.)
dispositions (id, name, category, requiresFollowUp, etc.)

-- Dynamic RBAC System (ProCRM Spec)
roles (id, name, description, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt)
permissions (id, resource, action, description, isActive)
user_roles (userId, roleId, assignedBy, assignedAt, expiresAt)
role_permissions (roleId, permissionId, grantedBy, grantedAt)
audit_logs (id, actorId, action, entity, entityId, oldValue, newValue, timestamp)
permissions (id, resource, action, description, etc.)
user_roles (userId, roleId, assignedAt, etc.)
role_permissions (roleId, permissionId, canRead, canWrite, etc.)

-- VICIdial Integration
vicidial_campaigns (id, name, pacingRatio, maxCallsPerAgent, etc.)
vicidial_logs (id, callId, leadId, agentId, status, timestamp, etc.)
dialer_metrics (id, campaignId, callsAttempted, connected, dropped, etc.)

-- File Management
upload_batches (id, filename, totalRecords, successCount, etc.)
```

### **Integration Points**
- **VICIdial Database**: Read-only access to leads, call logs, agent states  
- **File System**: CSV/Excel uploads in `/uploads` directory
- **Redis Cache**: Session management and real-time metrics
- **WebSocket**: Real-time dashboard updates

---

## 🔌 Integration Strategy

### **VICIdial Integration Approach**
1. **Database Direct**: Connect to VICIdial MySQL database for lead management
2. **API Endpoints**: Create CRM endpoints that VICIdial can call
3. **Webhook System**: Receive real-time call events from VICIdial
4. **File Sync**: Import/export lead data via CSV matching VICIdial format

### **Frontend-Backend Communication**
- **REST APIs**: Standard CRUD operations  
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates for dashboards and agent status
- **File Upload**: Multipart form data for CSV/Excel processing
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access control

---

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance Plan

### **RBAC Implementation**
- **Hierarchical Roles**: Super Admin > Admin > Manager > Agent
- **Granular Permissions**: Resource-based (accounts:read, dialer:configure, etc.)
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Users can have multiple roles with time-based expiration
- **Audit Trail**: All permission changes logged with user, timestamp, reason

### **Data Protection**
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Logging**: All data access logged for compliance
- **Session Management**: JWT with refresh tokens, configurable expiration
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated

---

## 📈 Performance & Scalability Plan

### **Real-time Requirements**
- **Dashboard Updates**: < 3 seconds for metric refresh
- **Call Events**: < 1 second for call status changes  
- **Agent Status**: < 2 seconds for availability updates
- **Dialer Adjustments**: < 5 seconds for pacing changes

### **Load Handling Strategy**
- **Database Indexing**: Optimize queries for account search, call history
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data (user sessions, metrics)
- **Background Jobs**: Queue system for bulk uploads and report generation
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections for high concurrency

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### **Testing Strategy** 
- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic (dialing algorithms, RBAC rules)
- **Integration Tests**: VICIdial connectivity, database operations
- **API Tests**: All endpoint functionality and error handling
- **Load Tests**: High-volume call processing and concurrent users
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, input validation

### **Deployment Strategy**
- **Development**: Local environment with Docker containers
- **Staging**: Cloud environment mirroring production
- **Production**: High-availability setup with monitoring and backups

---

## 📋 Risk Management

### **Technical Risks**
- **VICIdial Integration Complexity**: Mitigate with thorough API documentation study
- **Real-time Performance**: Implement caching and optimize database queries early
- **Data Migration**: Plan careful migration strategy for existing client data
- **Predictive Algorithm Accuracy**: Start with simple pacing, iterate based on data

### **Business Risks** 
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure dialing rates comply with telecom regulations
- **Data Security**: Implement comprehensive security from day one
- **User Adoption**: Design intuitive interfaces based on call center workflows
- **Scalability**: Plan for growth in users, accounts, and call volume
