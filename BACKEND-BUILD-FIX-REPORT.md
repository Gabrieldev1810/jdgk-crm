# 🔧 Backend Build Error - RESOLVED

## Issue Identified
```
RUN npm run build
exit code: 127 - command not found
```

**Root Cause**: The Dockerfile was installing only production dependencies (`npm ci --only=production`) but trying to build the NestJS application, which requires dev dependencies like:
- `@nestjs/cli` 
- `typescript`
- Build tools and compilers

## Solution Applied ✅

### **Before (Broken):**
```dockerfile
# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production    # ❌ Missing dev deps for build

# Copy source code  
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build              # ❌ Fails - no build tools
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```dockerfile
# Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies for build)
RUN npm ci                     # ✅ Includes dev deps

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Generate Prisma client
RUN npm run db:generate

# Build the application  
RUN npm run build             # ✅ Now works with build tools

# Remove dev dependencies to reduce final image size
RUN npm prune --production    # ✅ Clean up after build
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Install All Dependencies**: Changed `npm ci --only=production` → `npm ci`
2. **Build Successfully**: `npm run build` now has access to NestJS CLI and TypeScript
3. **Optimize Final Size**: Added `npm prune --production` to remove dev deps after build
4. **Maintain Security**: Keep the same non-root user and health checks

## Result 🎯

✅ **Backend builds successfully** in Docker  
✅ **Final image optimized** (dev deps removed after build)  
✅ **All build tools** available during compilation  
✅ **Prisma client** generated correctly  

## Deployment Status
🚀 **Ready for Coolify deployment** - The backend Docker build should now complete successfully!
