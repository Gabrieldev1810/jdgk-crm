# ðŸ”§ Port Configuration Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Found
The original `docker-compose.yml` had a **critical port conflict**:
- Backend: Exposed on port 3000
- Frontend: Mapped to port 3000:80 
- **Problem**: Both services competing for port 3000 in Coolify

## Solution Applied âœ…

### Updated Configuration:
```yaml
# Backend Service
backend:
  expose: ["3001"]  # Changed from 3000
  environment:
    - PORT=3001      # Changed from 3000
  healthcheck:
    - "http://localhost:3001/api/health"  # Updated

# Frontend Service  
frontend:
  ports: ["3000:80"]  # Frontend remains main entry point
  environment:
    - BACKEND_URL=http://backend:3001  # Points to new backend port
```

### Nginx Configuration Updated:
```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend:3001;  # Changed from 3000
}
```

## Result ðŸŽ¯
- **Frontend**: Accessible on port 3000 (main Coolify endpoint)
- **Backend**: Internal communication on port 3001  
- **No Conflicts**: Clean service separation
- **Coolify Ready**: Single exposed port (3000) for deployment

## Deployment Status
âœ… **Fixed and pushed to repository**  
âœ… **Ready for Coolify deployment**  
âœ… **Proper service architecture**

Your Coolify deployment should now work without port conflicts!
