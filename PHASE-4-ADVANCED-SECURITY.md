# DIAL-CRAFT RBAC PHASE 4: ADVANCED SECURITY FEATURES

## Implementation Plan

### üîê Phase 4 Features Overview
1. **Dynamic Permission Scoping** - Context-aware permissions based on data ownership, time, and location
2. **Advanced Audit Logging** - Comprehensive security event tracking with risk scoring
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication** - TOTP-based 2FA for enhanced login security
4. **Session Security** - Advanced session management with device tracking
5. **Data Encryption** - Field-level encryption for sensitive PII/PCI data
6. **Security Headers & CSP** - Enhanced web security with content security policies

### üéØ Technical Implementation Details

#### 1. Dynamic Permission Scoping
- **Contextual Permissions**: Permissions that adapt based on:
  - Data ownership (users can only modify their own records)
  - Time-based access (business hours restrictions)
  - IP/location-based access (office network restrictions)
  - Device trust levels (registered vs unregistered devices)

#### 2. Advanced Security Monitoring
- **Risk Scoring Engine**: Automatic threat detection based on:
  - Unusual access patterns
  - Multiple failed login attempts
  - Access from new devices/locations
  - Privilege escalation attempts

#### 3. Data Protection
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive fields like:
  - Customer phone numbers
  - Payment information
  - Personal identification data
  - Call recordings metadata
