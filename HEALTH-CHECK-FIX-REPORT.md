# Health Check Fix - Deployment Issue Resolution

## Issue Identified
The backend container was failing health checks during Coolify deployment, preventing the frontend from starting due to `depends_on` configuration.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Port Mismatch**: Dockerfile health check was using `http://localhost:3000/api/health` but backend runs on port `3001`
2. **Insufficient Startup Time**: Health check started too early (5s) before backend fully initialized
3. **Timeout Too Short**: 3s timeout wasn't enough for backend response

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Correct Health Check Port
**Fixed**: Updated Dockerfile health check URL from port 3000 to 3001
```dockerfile
# Before
CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:3000/api/health || exit 1

# After  
CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:3001/api/health || exit 1
```

### 2. Improved Timing Configuration
**Enhanced**: Increased startup period and timeout for proper initialization
```dockerfile
# Before
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3

# After
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=40s --retries=3
```

## Configuration Verification
- ✅ Backend runs on port 3001 (confirmed via Docker Compose `PORT=3001`)
- ✅ Health endpoint exists at `/api/health` (HealthController verified)
- ✅ Global prefix set to `api` (main.ts confirmed)
- ✅ wget installed in Alpine container (Dockerfile confirmed)

## Expected Results
1. **Backend Container**: Should pass health checks after 40s startup period
2. **Frontend Container**: Will start successfully once backend is healthy
3. **Complete Deployment**: Both services running and accessible

## Commit Details
- **Commit**: `6e7ffe24` - "fix: correct health check port from 3000 to 3001 and increase startup timing"
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Gabrieldev1810/jdgk-crm.git
- **Branch**: main

## Next Steps for Coolify Deployment
1. Trigger new deployment in Coolify to use updated health check
2. Monitor deployment logs for successful health check passage
3. Verify both backend (3001) and frontend (3000) services are running
4. Test API endpoints and frontend functionality

## Health Check Validation
The backend should now properly respond to health checks at:
- **Internal**: `http://localhost:3001/api/health`
- **External**: `http://backend:3001/api/health` (from frontend container)

This fix resolves the final deployment blocker for the Dial-Craft CRM on Coolify.
