## Overview
CYCLE 2 of the RBAC enhancement has been successfully implemented, adding comprehensive input validation, sanitization, and audit logging capabilities to complement the authorization system built in CYCLE 1.

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. Input Validation Middleware (`input-validation.middleware.ts`)
**Purpose**: Request-level input sanitization and validation with security threat detection

**Key Features**:

- ‚úÖ Type validation (string, email, UUID, number, boolean, array, object)
- ‚úÖ Length validation with configurable min/max limits
- ‚úÖ Pattern matching with regex support for complex formats
- ‚úÖ Allowed values validation for enums and restricted fields
- ‚úÖ HTML/XSS sanitization using DOMPurify
- ‚úÖ Recursive object sanitization for nested data structures
- ‚úÖ Route-based validation configuration with dynamic pattern matching

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents XSS attacks through HTML content sanitization
- Validates data types to prevent type confusion attacks
- Enforces business rules at the request level
- Removes potentially dangerous script content
- Normalizes input data for consistent processing

### 2. Comprehensive Audit Logging Service (`audit-logging.service.ts`)
**Purpose**: Complete audit trail with security event monitoring and dashboard analytics

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ General audit event logging with rich metadata capture

### 5. Enhanced RBAC Controller Integration
**Purpose**: Applied comprehensive audit logging to all RBAC operations

**Protected Operations with Audit Trails**:
- ‚úÖ `GET /rbac/roles` - Role viewing with access tracking
- ‚úÖ `POST /rbac/roles` - Role creation with full request/response logging
- ‚úÖ `PUT /rbac/roles/:id` - Role updates with change tracking
- ‚úÖ `DELETE /rbac/roles/:id` - Role deletion with security logging
- ‚úÖ `POST /rbac/admin/fix-permissions` - Critical admin operations with detailed audit

**Audit Configuration Examples**:
```typescript
@AuditLog({ 
  action: 'CREATE_ROLE', 
  resource: 'RBAC',
  includeRequestBody: true,
  includeResponseBody: true,
  sensitiveFields: []
})
```

### 6. Security Event Integration in Permissions Guard
**Purpose**: Real-time security monitoring integrated with authorization

**Enhanced Security Events**:

- ‚úÖ **PERMISSION_DENIED**: Insufficient permissions with detailed context
- ‚úÖ **INVALID_TOKEN**: JWT verification failures
- ‚úÖ Automatic severity classification and alerting
- ‚úÖ IP address and user agent tracking
- ‚úÖ Endpoint and method context capture
- ‚úÖ User permission vs required permission analysis
